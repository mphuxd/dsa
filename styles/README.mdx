# Styles

Styles for the design system.

In design systems, styles are often packaged and bundled separately from the component package, allowing styles to be used in across frameworks and web components. This requires build tools such as Gulp, PostCSS, Webpack, or Rollup. Components, themes, icons, and other assets are often individually packaged so users can install packages and dependencies as needed. For this example we will skip these steps and use Next.js's internal build tools for our css.
