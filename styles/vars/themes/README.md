# Themes

Themes are essentially color palettes used to define visual styles and the overall look and feel of the user interface. It provides a consistent set of design choices that are applied throughout the theme to create a consistent visual style. When you change themes, you are changing the theme tokens color values to set of values that correspond to another theme. Themes are typically used to change color schemes such as light and dark modes.

Theme tokens are important because they can be used to universally apply colors to common UI components. Some common theme color tokens are text, border, background, and background layer. Themes also extend to components such as buttons where theming can be more complex.
